# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation - Samantha Alexis Manuel, DH110

## Tentative Title: With Ingredients that Bind (Family) 

My project focuses on preserving family traditions through recipe and  food connections. 
For many Filipinos like me, my most cherished inheritance or heirlooms are the recipes that are passed down orally in the kitchen. Whenever I cook my Filipino food, it transforms into a moment of cultural-culinary, intergenerational connection– ever-changing rituals revised by each new generation. It helps me maintain a rootedness in my own cultural ancestry while living here in America, so I was curious to see if any apps existed to help preserve or share family recipes.  In this assignment, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of two apps peripheral to the goals of this project.

## Competitor A: Remento

#### Background Information
Remento is an app that allows you to preserve your family’s treasured memories. With their conversation prompts and simple recording tools, you can consolidate your family history into a private digital library. 

#### Heuristic Evaluation 
_Overall Evaluation_: Overall, this app is very aesthetically pleasing to look at, intuitive to use, and its prompts help to guide meaningful conversations. More importantly, it captures sentimental features of a story– emotion, facial expression, and voice. I make minor recommendations to increase user efficiency and engagement, but it is, overall, a very thoughtful app with the option of creating your own prompts. Contentwise, very compelling and beautiful to look at. 




## Competitor  B: Bublup

#### Background Information
Bublup is an app that allows you to access and share your files, but in this context, your favorite recipes from anywhere in the world. You may simply upload and digitally organize recipes with your smartphone, desktop, or tablet and you access them at any time. 

#### Heuristic Evaluation 
_Overall Evaluation_: Overall, Bublup, as a project management app, is helpful in that it works by saving and storing all your digital documents, specifically recipes. One of the features that Bublup offers is a way to organize and share recipes in one central location as well as archive recipes found online. Furthermore, you are able to create your own digital cookbook with a Bublup roll (aka a customized webpage). Despite being text heavy and not the most visually appealing app,  it presents many capabilities and includes more personalization options (in terms of personal preference for app display) than the previous app.
